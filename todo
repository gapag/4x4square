1) add "play/stop" button and a spinner to tell the speed of reproduction
  which:
    on play:
      disable interpreter 
      disable drops on all items/scene
      disable action list
      set current item as 0
      start a timer that every time:
        1. selects the current item
        2. applies the transformation
        3. updates the screen
        4. increases the selection pointer and restarts the timer
      The reproduced items are those selected ones
      When selection comes to the end, resets the grid and starts again.
      
      
    on stop:
      kill timer
      reset the grid
      rerun the whole transformation list
      display the grid
      enable interpreter
      enable drops on all item scenes
      enable action list
    
2) When one presses "print", prompt for filename.
3) Add menus:

   * info

4) Help button QWhatsthis and relative instructions
